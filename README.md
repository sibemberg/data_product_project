## App Link
You can find the app here: https://sibemberg.shinyapps.io/Data_Product_Project/

## Documentation
This very simple app loads the `iris` dataset, run a k-means clustering model and show some information about it:  
- Scatterplot of all variables, 2x2, colored by cluster;  
- Correlation, 2x2 (overall and splitted by cluster);  
- Overall density distribution of each cluster, by variable;  
  
You can choose the number of clusters (k) from 1 to 10, by using the slider.  
You can also select which variables will be included into the model and those who will appear on the chart.

Thank you!
